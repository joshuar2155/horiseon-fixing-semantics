#  <Horiseon Fixing Semantics>

## Description

This project is designed to test my optimization skills. The original code is muddled. Although functional, there are many areas where improvements and clean-up are applicable. My job is to "simplify" the code as much as possible to make it more accessible to other potential collaborators and the fictitious company.

- My motivation is to challenge my semantic skills
- I built this project as a good challenge to begin my coding journey
- This exercise will solve very profound fundamentals to HTMl and CSS
- I learned a great deal of patience and attention to detail

## Installation

This project is already functional. The process lies in fixing the code. The environment is running properly, but it requires a more friendly interface.

## Usage

Identify areas in both the HTML and CSS where the code feels like there is a more simplistic and accessible alternative.
